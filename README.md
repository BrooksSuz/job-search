# Job Search (A Web Scraping Application)

## Overview

This personal project was born out of a desire to create something meaningful and helpful for those around me. A tool to streamline the job search process. The result is a web application that uses Puppeteer, a JavaScript library, to scrape job listings from career pages.

Currently, it supports the University of Toledo's career page, but the vision is to expand its capabilities to scrape a variety of websites based on user-provided input. Users will be able to input keywords and target sites, and the scraper will return job listings that match the criteria.

The application runs on Node.js, and integration with MongoDB is planned to manage user data, saved job listings, and more.

## Features

### Keyword Search

Enter your desired keywords into the "Keywords" input field. Click the "Get Jobs" button and let the scraper do the rest!

### Advanced Settings (Coming Soon)

This feature will allow you to configure the scraper for different websites. Once complete, detailed instructions will be added here.

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

### Data Persistence

Integration with MongoDB to store user data, saved jobs, and scraper configurations.

### Email Notifcations

A Nodemailer setup to send automated updates when new jobs are found for your keywords.

### Expanded Scraping Capabilities

Support for multiple job boards and custom website configurations.

### Improved User Experience

Enhanced UI/UX for easier navigation and functionality.

## Why This Project?

Job searching can be overwhelming, and I wanted to create a tool that simplifies it, saving people time and energy. While this application is still in its early stages, it's built with scalability and user convenience in mind.

Whether you're a job seeker or just exploring what's possible with web scraping, I hope you find this project helpful!
